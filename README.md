An example to walk you through how to use [**Azure Event Hubs**](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/?WT.mc_id=data-0000-abhishgu) integration with [**Dapr**](https://dapr.io/), a set of distributed system building blocks for microservices development. Azure Event Hubs will be used as a "binding" within the Dapr runtime. This will allow services to communicate with Azure Event Hubs without actually knowing about it or being coupled to it directly (via SDK, library etc.), using a simple model defined by the Dapr runtime.
